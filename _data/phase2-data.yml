    key-consideration: Enterprise integration
    description: Determine the context of the blockchain system.
    analysis: For most enterprise use cases, blockchain technology will be part of the core infrastructure and should be able to integrate seamlessly with other legacy systems.
    takeaway: Create a concept of operations (CONOPS) for the proposed solution to explain the system context in the vision.
  - id: 6
    key-consideration: Value transfer risks
    description: Identify and manage value transfer risks for the value transfer use cases.
    analysis: A blockchain needs to manage the risks that were being handled by the central intermediaries whom they aim to eliminate. These include fraud detection, key management, asset security, and other risks associated with the value transfer network.
    takeaway: Risk management will need to go beyond traditional people, process, and technology risks to create the management process for risks associated with security, fraud, and new costs of the proposed solution.
  - id: 7
    key-consideration: Consensus mechanism
    description: Define the consensus mechanism.
    analysis: Readiness Phase activities should include rethinking the conceptual model for Interagency Agreements and/or Memorandums of Understanding/Agreement to shift away from a centralized security approach. This may need education for information security and procurement teams to understand the complexities and evolving needs of blockchain security.
    takeaway: Create common understanding on consensus and security mechanisms, as well as corresponding participant liabilities and responsibilities.
  - id: 8
    key-consideration: Performance expectations
    description: Establish pragmatic performance expectations in terms of metrics, such as transaction speed.
    analysis: Blockchains are not a replacement of traditional high-performing, super-tuned databases. They are a complementary technology meant to solve different problem domains/use cases.
    takeaway: Create realistic non-functional requirements due to current blockchain capability tradeoffs.
  - id: 9
    key-consideration: Framework-based design
    description: Establish guidelines for a blockchain technology framework that is modular, reusable, and extendible.
    analysis: The technological landscape is fluid. Projects based on today's solutions will have to be reworked or re- implemented onto the eventual leading platforms in the future. Consider government wide initiatives using a shared services/platform approach and open source software.
    takeaway: Blockchain is still an emerging technology. Aim for reusability but, more importantly, modularity and extensibility.

    key-consideration: Cross-functional team
    description: Establish a cross-functional government team.
    analysis: In addition to enterprise IT and business and functional teams, blockchain initiatives must engage with customers in this phase. The governance team must ensure to engage risk management, regulatory compliance, IT operations, finance, accounting and tax teams, etc. to ensure that the requirements of these stakeholders are recorded appropriately.
    takeaway: Create commitment. Draft charters to ensure ongoing support from multiple organizations. Identify tools that can support inter- and intra-organizational development and communication activities (e.g. using cloud-based public-sector tools, etc.)
  - id: 11
    key-consideration: Talent management
    description: Define the skillset and training needed to implement and maintain blockchain initiatives.
    analysis: Organizations will need experienced IT talent who can implement and maintain blockchains, as well as support network participants. Government agencies may have to rely on technology partners and third-party vendors who have a working knowledge of different blockchain ecosystems.
    takeaway: Consider training and developing internal talent for continuity while leveraging external talent on an as needed basis for immediate initiatives.

    key-consideration: User experience
    description: Establish user- centric design guidelines.
    analysis: Blockchain is generally considered a backend technology which end-user facing system rarely see directly. That may or may not be true for all the use cases. Other than the underlying code and algorithm, every user touch point must be designed with user-centricity focus. All users – such as backend, administrators and enterprise users – should get the same quality of experience as the end users. Laying the ground rules for design right from Readiness Phase helps in enterprise-wide adoption in the long run and in covering all the non- functional requirements, such as privacy, confidentiality, security and personalization.
    takeaway: User experience is critical for enterprise- wide adoption and should be looked from middle/backend users’ perspective across every user touchpoint that is in the purview of the selected use case(s). Iterative agile approach with product ownership and Lean UX techniques can be utilized to ensure the best user experience.
