# Appendix C – Popular Blockchain Platforms
## Popular open source/proprietary Blockchain/DLT systems[8]
Below are the most popular blockchain platforms in the market at the time of the writing of this Playbook. The table also provides the highlights of the features of these systems. Use these to determine the system that is best suited for your use case.

When deciding whether to use open source over proprietary software, use this table as a guide to determine which suits your organization better, especially if you want to be able to “extend” the software or not. Open source (defined in Glossary) typically allows organizations that use the software to extend as they see fit.
