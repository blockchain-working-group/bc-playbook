# Glossary

### Blockchain (further defined in the ACT-IAC Blockchain Primer)
A blockchain underpins a digital ledger in a peer-to-peer network which timestamps records by cryptographically hashing them into an ongoing chain of blocks, recorded chronologically and publically, forming an immutable record that is distributed across peer nodes.

### Colored Coin Protocol / Deployment Model
Colored coin protocols share the user authentication model to associate real assets with addresses on the underlying blockchain.

### Custodian
A person or a system that is responsible or looks after something, in the banking environment, custodians are specialized financial institutions responsible for safeguarding an individual's financial assets.

### Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (further defined in Appendix H)
Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are software-based entities whose decisions are generally made electronically by computer code.

### Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT - further defined in the ACT-IAC Blockchain Primer)
A peer-to-peer network, which uses a defined consensus mechanism to prevent modification of an ordered series of time-stamped records.

### Immutability
Not subject to or susceptible to be changed.

### Membership
The ability or permissioned to participate in a blockchain network, usually controlled by a set of rules such as ‘PoW’ and validated by other members.

### Metacoin Protocol / Deployment Model
A metacoin system is a colored coin protocol coupled with a middleware layer in the form of dedicated servers, which verify colored coin transactions.

### MGT Act
The Modernizing Government Technology Act is a piece of legislature passed by the United States Congress in 2017 that provides a policy and guidance to modernize technology that supports the Federal Government. https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/115/hr2227.

### Multi-Asset Blockchain Protocol
A protocol allowing multiple assets to be natively supported by a blockchain.

### Node
A system that is part of a decentralized peer-to-peer (P2P) blockchain network.

### Open-Source
Denotes software for which the original source code is made freely available to the public and may be redistributed and modified.

### Permissioned Blockchain (further defined in the ACT-IAC Blockchain Primer)
A private network where permission to write to the blockchain is controlled by a single or a group of organization.

### Phase Input
Material or artifacts needed at the beginning of a phase.

### Phase Outcome
Derived effect of activities within a phase.

### Phase Output
Specific products or deliverables of a phase that can be used in the subsequent phase.

### Proprietary
Software owned by an individual or a company (usually the one that developed it), typically with restrictions on its use or its source code (contrast with open-source).

### Public Blockchain (further defined in the ACT-IAC Blockchain Primer)
Generally open-source, public blockchains support multiple readers and writers with open read/write capability. Any participant is able to validate to the integrity of the block.
