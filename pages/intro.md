# Introduction

Blockchain has the potential to help government to reduce fraud, errors, and the cost of paper-intensive processes, while enabling collaboration across multiple divisions and agencies to provide more efficient and effective services to citizens. The adoption of blockchain may enable government agencies to provide new value-added services and modernize IT in ways to realize IT savings that might be reinvested. But how can agencies turn that potential into reality?

 - Understand the technology using the Blockchain Primer: Over one dozen federal agencies and a variety of industry partners collaborated to provide the government workforce with an introduction to blockchain and its related technologies, as well as its many potential use cases, in the ACT-IAC Blockchain Primer.

 - Incorporate blockchain functionality using the Blockchain Playbook: Now the ACT-IAC Blockchain Working Group comes together again to guide the government workforce in taking the appropriate steps and developing the necessary plans to implement the right technology to achieve the goals of their mission.

 - Blockchain and Decentralized Organizations: Blockchain has the potential to significantly impact both business processes as well as the fabric of the organization. The usual linear value chain, where value is added in strict sequential order, is being replaced by networked value chain where entities and the entire environment are networked together with smart contracts and other automated code. In a networked value chain enabled by blockchain, there is a more efficient use of resources and process execution which leads to cost savings and reductions in cycle times. In terms of the organizational structure, classical hierarchical layers may be replaced by a new model emerging from implementations of blockchain and other digital transformation technologies – decentralized organization.  These decentralized organization leverage intelligent and distributed nodes that are empowered to execute various processes without human intervention or central oversight.

This playbook applies the concepts of the General Services Administration’s Modernization and Migration Management (M3) unified shared services framework to help the government achieve successful outcomes and reduce risk during a blockchain deployment, which should involve the modernization of information systems, as well as the migration of data and/or other capabilities. The progression of this framework ensures the government will be able to optimize its resources to deliver the most effective solution.

Users may leverage this playbook during each iteration of a blockchain solution’s implementation: minimally viable product, proof of concept, pilot/limited fielding, initial operational capability, full operational capability, etc.  Not all topics in each phase may apply to all iterations, but the playbook should remain useful as a solution moves through its lifecycle.   

Note that to address the current high level of government interest and desire to begin deploying blockchain solutions, launch of this playbook will happen in two stages.  Work on the next launch stage will begin in April 2018 to continue supporting these efforts as they evolve.

As government efforts move through implementation of this new and rapidly developing technology, contributions to this playbook online of additional best practices, lessons learned, and other information are appreciated to ensure this resource is current, comprehensive, and effective in meeting the needs of government.

The first three phases of a five-phased approach, which includes key activities and outcomes for each phase, are addressed in this edition of the playbook.  

Phase 1 Problem Assessment: Develop a vision and business plan through various assessments to ensure the blockchain solution addresses a specific use case and delivers results that optimize services and operational delivery while complying with regulations and accounting for cultural change management, as well as technical modernization and interoperability needs.

Phase 2 Organizational Readiness: Engage blockchain subject matter experts and consider the nuances that accompany a blockchain solution to prepare the organization(s) for deployment, including the standup of a project management office, as well as the establishment of blockchain-tailored business, functional, and technical requirements and implementation plans.

Phase 3 Technology Selection: Conduct a thorough investigation of the business considerations (e.g. consensus mechanism, transaction costs, and on chain/off chain data requirements), types of blockchains, digital asset and distributed ledger technology (DLT) requirements and considerations, deployment models, and procurement options to enable optimal provider selection to achieve the desired end state.

Also included at the end of this playbook are a glossary to assist with the in-depth terminology associated with advanced blockchain concepts and appendices to elaborate on each selection topic at a more granular level. 

In late 2018, the next edition of the playbook will be published, covering the final phases of the framework: Phase 4 Implementation and Phase 5 Integration.
